# ColorDetector
Colors are everywhere around us, but many shades look similar and can be hard to tell apart. For people with color blindness, this becomes even more challenging. To make it easier, this project introduces a simple color detector. By clicking on any part of an image, it identifies and displays the name of the color in text format.
